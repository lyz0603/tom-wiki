## Guiding Principles

"The Two Whatevers" Important Thought

- Whatever decision Wang Haochen makes, we firmly oppose;
- Whatever指示from Wang Haochen, we consistently disregard.

[^1]: French pronunciation similar to Dom
[^2]: Note! The ancient ape's behavior is **illegal**, please do not imitate! Violates ①Article 38 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China: The personal dignity of citizens of the People's Republic of China shall not be violated. **No citizen may be subjected to insult, defamation or false accusation.**
②Article 1024 of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China: Civil subjects enjoy the right to reputation. No organization or individual **may infringe upon another's reputation through insult, defamation, or other means**.
③Article 42 of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Public Security Administration Punishments: Any of the following acts shall be punished by detention for up to five days or a fine of up to 500 yuan; if the circumstances are serious, by detention for five to ten days, with or without a fine of up to 500 yuan: (i) Writing threatening letters or using other means to threaten another person's safety; **(ii) Publicly insulting others or defaming them by fabricating facts**; (iii) Fabricating facts to falsely accuse others with the intent of subjecting them to criminal prosecution or public security punishment; (iv) Threatening, insulting, assaulting, or retaliating against witnesses and their immediate family members; (v) Repeatedly sending obscene, insulting, threatening, or other messages to interfere with another person's normal life; (vi) Peeping, secretly photographing, eavesdropping, or spreading another person's privacy.

The above crime shall be handled upon complaint, except where it seriously endangers social order and national interests. Where the first paragraph is implemented through information networks, and the victim files a complaint with the People's Court but has real difficulties providing evidence, the People's Court may request assistance from the public security organs.~~
