**Unusual Tom around the world**[^1]

Tom is a chimpanzee, and it likes food! But when it asks, 'Do you want a banana?', be careful. Most of us eat fresh bananas, but Tom always eats rotten bananas. Tom says, 'I eat sushi - rotten fish - all the time in rain forests. So it isn't surprising that I eat rotten bananas too!'

## Ancient Ape Questions

- A compound made of two elements can react with metal elements, metal oxides, non-metal elements, and non-metal oxides. What can it be?
    - Reference answer: ~~water~~ Tom[^2]
    - Analysis: Tom$ToM$ can react with the following:
        - Metal elements: (selin) sodium$Na$
        - $2ToM + 2Na \rightarrow To_2 \uparrow + 2NaM$<br />
        - Metal oxides: banana oxide$BnO$
        - $ToM + BnO \rightarrow ToO \downarrow +  BnM$<br />
        - Non-metal elements: earth beetle$Tb$
        - $2ToM + 2Tb \rightarrow To_2 \uparrow + 2TbM$<br />
        - Non-metal oxides: (Dingding's) silicon dioxide$SiO_2$
        - $2ToM + SiO_2 \rightarrow 2ToO \downarrow + SiM_2$
